# ADILE DRIVE - APK GENERATION & INSTALLATION GUIDE

## 1. GENERATING THE APK (No Software Needed)
Use **GitHub Actions** (The professional way):
1. Push your code to a GitHub Repository.
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab on GitHub.
3. Select **"Build Android APK"** and let it run (5 minutes).
4. When finished, click the run, scroll down to **"Artifacts"**, and download the APK.

## 2. INSTALLING ON YOUR PHONE
Once you have the `.apk` file:

### Step A: Transfer to Phone
- Send the file to yourself via **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, or upload it to **Google Drive**.
- Alternatively, connect your phone to your computer via USB and copy the file to the "Downloads" folder.

### Step B: Allow Unknown Sources
1. On your phone, go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Special App Access**.
2. Tap **Install unknown apps**.
3. Select the app you'll use to open the APK (e.g., "Files" or "Chrome") and toggle **Allow from this source** to ON.

### Step C: Run the Installer
1. Open your **File Manager** app on the phone.
2. Find `app-debug.apk` and tap it.
3. Tap **Install**.

### Step D: "Play Protect" Warning
Because this is a custom-built app, your phone might say "Unsafe app blocked". 
- Tap **"More Details"** (small arrow).
- Tap **"Install Anyway"**.

## 3. TROUBLESHOOTING
- **"App not installed"**: This usually means you already have an older version of Adile Drive installed with a different signature. Delete the old version first.
- **"Parsing error"**: Ensure you downloaded the full file and it didn't get corrupted during transfer.
- **"Staging Commit Error"**: If GitHub tells you "something went wrong" when saving, ensure you are logged in and haven't hit the file size limit (this project is small, so it should be fine). Try refreshing the page.
