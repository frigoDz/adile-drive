# ADILE DRIVE - APK GENERATION (WITHOUT ANDROID STUDIO)

If you don't want to install Android Studio, use one of these two Cloud Build methods.

## OPTION A: VoltBuilder (Easiest / No Setup)
This is a web service that converts your web code to an APK in minutes.

1. **Prepare your files:**
   - Run `npm run build` in your terminal. This creates a `dist` folder.
   - Create a ZIP file containing: `dist`, `capacitor.config.json`, `package.json`, and the `android` folder (if you ran `npx cap add android`).
2. **Upload:**
   - Go to [VoltBuilder.com](https://www.voltbuilder.com/).
   - Upload your ZIP file.
3. **Download:**
   - They will process the build on their servers.
   - Once finished, they will provide a download link for your `.apk` file.

## OPTION B: GitHub Actions (Professional & Free)
I have created a file for you in `.github/workflows/android.yml`. This allows GitHub to build your APK every time you push code.

1. **Push your code to a GitHub Repository.**
2. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your GitHub repository.
3. You will see a workflow named "Build Android APK".
4. Once it finishes (takes ~5-8 mins), click on the build run.
5. Under **"Artifacts"**, you can download the `app-release.apk`.

## OPTION C: Ionic Appflow
Ionic (the creators of Capacitor) offer a professional dashboard.
1. Create an account at [ionicframework.com/appflow](https://ionicframework.com/appflow).
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Click "Build" and choose "Android". It will generate the APK for you in the cloud.

### IMPORTANT: Fixing the "Moved, edited, or deleted" error
This error often happens in web previews when the URL changes. To prevent this in your mobile app:
1. Ensure you use `HashRouter` (already implemented).
2. NEVER use `window.location.href = ...` or `window.location.reload()`.
3. Always use the `useNavigate()` hook from `react-router-dom`.
